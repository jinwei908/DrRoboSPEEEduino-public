# Doctor Robo Arduino Source Code v1.0.1

This is an Arduino Source code for the SPEEEduino that I developed for the ASEAN 100 Hackathon for Connected Smart Cities from 2nd October to 3rd October 2017.

This code utilizes SPEEEduino - which is an IoT enabled Arduino board - to control 3 servo motors which acts as "dispensers" by communicating with a web server (Doctor Robo Web Server). It also sends environmental data from a BOSCH XDK to the web server.

This has been deployed on the Amazon Cloud so it can be accessed from anywhere, anytime.

This project is built in 2 days from 2nd OCT 2017 to 3rd OCT 2017 for the ASEAN 100 Hackathon, It comes with 4 other applications (Doctor, Patient, Ambulance, Kiosk) as well as numerous IoT sensors and motors to power the entire system.
